Terraform

What is terraform?

Terraform ia an opensource infrastructure as a code tool mostly used for managing public clouds such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Digital ocean


Terraform is a distributed as a CLI and is used for writing declartive infrastructure as code
Terraform is a hashicorp product.


Basic Terraform configuration

simple one code for configuring a AWS services like VPC and its managing sources

For eg Im going to create VPC, subnets, IGW, RT, Security groups, NAt gateway and 2 EC2 instance 

one instance from Public 
another one from private

This all services is configured from a single code in terraform as a infrasture code.

Previous terraform installation like binary package

move files to /usr/local/bin
# terraform --version
1.1.9

one IAM role for the instance

Providers
Resource 
In AWS we are calling all the thing as service 

resource "aws_vpc" "myvpc" {
  cidr_block       = "10.0.0.0/16"
  instance_tenancy = "default"

  tags = {
    Name = "my-vpc"
  }
}

logical name /reference name

resource "aws_subnet" "pubsub" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.myvpc.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"

  tags = {
    Name = "Public subnets"
  }
}

After IGW 

need to create RT one for public and pvt
need to create eip and Nat gatewy

resource "aws_nat_gateway" "nat" {
  allocation_id = aws_eip.eip.id
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.pubsub.id

  tags = {
    Name = "gw NAT"
  }
}


security group
resource "aws_security_group" "allow_all" {
  name        = "allow_all"
  description = "Allow TLS inbound traffic"
  vpc_id      = aws_vpc.myvpc.id

  ingress {
    description      = "TLS from VPC"
    from_port        = 22
    to_port          = 22
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    
  }
  ingress {
    description      = "TLS from VPC"
    from_port        = 80
    to_port          = 80
    protocol         = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    
  }

  egress {
    from_port        = 0
    to_port          = 0
    protocol         = "-1"
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    ipv6_cidr_blocks = ["::/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name = "allow_all"
  }
}


ec2instance one in private and one in publc
